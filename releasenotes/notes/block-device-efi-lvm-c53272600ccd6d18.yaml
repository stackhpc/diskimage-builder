    Element block-device-efi-lvm has been added which is like block-device-efi
    but defines an LVM logical group in the root partition. Four logical
    volumes are defined in that group, mounted to /, /tmp, /var, and /home.

    This volume layout will not meet all requirements, but this is more of an
    example demonstrating the capability to encourage more usage of this
    existing feature.
