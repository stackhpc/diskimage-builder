    It is now possible to configure the dhcp-all-interfaces element not to
    install the dhcp-all-interfaces service on systems with NetworkManager.

    NetworkManager is quite capable to do automatic interface configuration.
    NetworkManager will by default try to auto-configure any interface with
    no configuration, it will use DHCP for IPv4 and Router Advertisements to
    decide how to initialize IPv6.

    The new environment variable ``DIB_DHCP_NETWORK_MANAGER_AUTO`` (defauls to:
    ``false``) has been added, when set to ``true`` only the configuration for
    NetworkManager is written.
