    The dhcp-all-interfaces element does not work correctly with the new
    "predictable names" scheme for network interfaces.
    During boot the name of the interfaces is changed from ethX to the new
    scheme, for example enpXsX; this name change is not detected by udev de
    facto making the udev rule of the dhcp-all-interfaces element useless;
    this causes the machine booted with the image including the dhcp-all-interfaces
    element to not get any ip and so being unreachable from the network.
    This patch includes a workaround to fallback to the "persistent names"
    scheme allowing the dhcp-all-interfaces element to work again as intended.
