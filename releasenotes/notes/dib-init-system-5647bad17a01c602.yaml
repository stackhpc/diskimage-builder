    The ``dib-init-system`` element installs a utility
    ``/usr/local/bin/dib-init-system`` which would try to guess the
    init system (systemd, etc.).  This was called from
    ``environment.d`` files, which means that in phases outside the
    chroot it was attempting to query the init system of the build
    host.  This completely fails in a situation such as running inside
    a container without a full init system.  To avoid this issue, each
    OS element will set DIB_INIT_SYSTEM directly.  The
    ``dib-init-system`` script was not really intended to be called
    directly, but will now just report the value of
    ``DIB_INIT_SYSTEM``.
