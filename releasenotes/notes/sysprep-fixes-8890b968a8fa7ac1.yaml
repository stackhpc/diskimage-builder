fixes:
  - |
    The sysprep element has been fixed to truncate ``/var/lib/dpkg/machine-id``
    (``/etc/machine-id`` was already being truncated). This ensures a
    machine-id is not packaged in the image and systemd will be forced to
    generate a new one upon first boot.
  - |
    The sysprep element is added as a dependency to the ``debootstrap`` element to
    ensure that it runs on all Debian builds, including debian-minimal based
    images.
