deprecations:
  - The ``DIB_[DISTRO]_DISTRIBUTION_MIRROR`` variables have been
    removed.  These were undocumented ways to set
    ``DIB_DISTRIBUTION_MIRROR`` for some elements.  It was not
    implemented consistently and causing some confusion.  If you need
    to setup mirrors for testing purposes, the
    ``openstack-ci-mirrors`` element is a good example that is used by
    OpenStack gate testing.
