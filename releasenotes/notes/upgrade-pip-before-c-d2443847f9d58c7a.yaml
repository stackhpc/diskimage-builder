    This fixes bug 1744403 where 60-ironic-agent-install fails to run
    when DIB_INSTALLTYPE_ironic_agent=source is set.  pip installs
    constraints with the -c argument and this argument is a relatively
    newer addion.  The currently installed pip may not support that
    option and must be upgraded before proceeding.
