features:
  - |
    The `ensure-venv` module is added to ensure that `python3 -m venv`
    is available on the host.  This can be useful if you wish to
    install non-distribution-packaged Python software on a host during
    build, but not mix any non-distro installation.  This works on all
    platforms with Python 3 available.
depreceations:
  - |
    The `simple-init` element now uses `ensure-venv` so is technically
    Python 3 only.  At this stage, all supported platforms have Python
    3 available.
