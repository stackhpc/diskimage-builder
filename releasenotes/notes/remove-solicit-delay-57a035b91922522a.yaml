    The ``DIB_SIMPLE_INIT_NETWORKMANAGER_IPV6_DELAY`` variable is removed as
    it turned out that increasing this delay increased the odds that
    NetworkManager would fail to configure IPv6 on an interface. Instead,
    glean has been updated to not up interfaces and relies on NetworkManager
    to do this. This results in reliable IPv4 and IPv6 config.
