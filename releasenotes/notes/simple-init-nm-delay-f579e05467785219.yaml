    The ``DIB_SIMPLE_INIT_NETWORKMANAGER_IPV6_DELAY`` variable is
    added for the ``simple-init`` element to set the
    ``net.ipv6.conf.default.router_solicition_delay`` sysctl setting
    (it defaults to 30s).  If you are seeing an extra "blank"
    interface in ``nmcli con show`` it is likely that NM has not
    correctly configured itself in the presence of an interface
    already configured with IPV6 by the kernel.  Increasing this value
    may help work-around the problem.
