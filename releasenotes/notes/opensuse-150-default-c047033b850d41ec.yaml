deprecations:
  - |
    Support in opensuse and opensuse-minimal for openSUSE 13.*  has been removed
    as these are end of life.

upgrade:
  - |
    The opensuse and opensuse-minimal element are now defaulting to build 15.0.
    Building for 42.2 and 42.3 is still supported, however requires setting
    DIB_RELEASE to '42.3' resp. '42.2' explicitly.
